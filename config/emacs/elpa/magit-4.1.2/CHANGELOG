* v4.1.2    2024-11-02

- Add various minor process logging improvements:
  5b30c05d3a magit--git-insert: Collapse process section if appropriate
  b11524120e magit--git-insert: Optionally always log to process buffer
  cd6cf89d6a Use different face for debug-only process sections
  bba06845de magit-process-insert-section: Improve file-path comparision
  f2a6133443 magit-run-git-async: No longer clutter ~*Messages*~ buffer

Bug fixes:

- If the left margin was in use before ~magit-blame-mode~ started using
  that margin, then the old width was not restored when the mode was
  disabled.  #5236

- Prior to Tramp being loaded, setting ~magit-tramp-pipe-stty-settings~
  to ~nil~ resulted in an error, due to ~tramp-pipe-stty-settings~ not
  being bound yet.  #5240

- ~magit-copy-section-value~ no longer did anything for most section
  types.  #5244.

- Global git arguments often got added twice to the list of arguments
  ultimately passed to git.  914285a5e8

- Inserting the headers of status buffers involves temporary changes
  to ~magit-insert-section-hook~.  These changes were not restricted to
  the current buffer, causing errors when ~magit-git-debug~ is enabled
  and we thus insert sections in the process buffer, while the status
  buffer is being refreshed.  11e13640c4

- Some ~git~ errors were not logged despite ~magit-git-debug~ being
  enabled.  874fb0fede

- ~magit-browse-thing~ and ~magit-visit-thing~ tried to turn anything
  at point into an URL.  Now the bail if there is no URL at point.

* v4.1.1    2024-10-01

- Avoid unnecessary work when ~auto-revert-remote-files~ is ~nil~.  #5222

- Improved default choice offered by ~magit-branch-reset~ and
  ~magit-reset-*~.  #5230

Bug fixes:

- Added a workaround for a regression in Git v2.46.0.  #5212

- Section-specific bindings were removed when a section was expanded
  whose body is not inserted until the expansion takes place.
  9395de2c94

- Addressed an incompatibility with Eglot.  #5226

- Adapted to a change in ~define-globalized-minor-mode~ in Emacs 30,
  which caused ~diff-hl-mode~ to be enabled in blob buffers.  #5229

- When adding the commit at point to the completion defaults, it was
  assumed that ~minibuffer-default-add-function~ cannot be nil.
  6d0075f523

- ~magit-blame--format-string-1~ didn't handle a list of faces
  correctly.  5395798301

- Addressed an incompatibility with Indent-Bars.  #5233

* v4.1.0    2024-09-01

- The library ~git-commit.el~ is no longer distributed as a separate
  package, ~git-commit~, but as part of the ~magit~ package.

- Improved ~magit-tag-release~'s consistency and handling of arguments.
  #5102

- Updated tooling and other housekeeping.

Bug fixes:

- Only use an explicit range in ~magit-insert-recent-commits~, when also
  using ~--graph~.  With ~--graph~ it increases performance noticeably,
  but without it decreases performance somewhat.  #5075

- ~magit-completing-read-multiple~ now shows the default choice in the
  prompt, if a completion framework is used, for which that is useful.
  #5205.
